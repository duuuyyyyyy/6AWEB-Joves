      <p class="profile-text">
        A highly motivated and passionate 3rd-Year Computer Science Student currently developing robust skills in Full-Stack Web Development. I specialize in creating user-centric design (UI/UX), leveraging modern frontend technologies like React and JavaScript (ES6+), and styling frameworks such as Tailwind CSS.
        I possess a strong foundation in designing highly performant and responsive solutions, having successfully delivered projects ranging from sleek, responsive websites to complex applications. My focus on innovative design and optimized code has consistently improved user engagement by up to 75% on past academic and personal projects. I am currently seeking an entry-level Web Developer or Frontend role where I can apply my expertise in UI/UX principles while rapidly expanding my backend capabilities to contribute across the entire development lifecycle.
